= Meilisearch Operation Support

This chapter covers additional support for Meilisearch operations that cannot be directly accessed via the repository interface.

[[meilisearch.operations.search]]
== Basic Search

Spring Data Meilisearch provides basic search functionality through the `search` method:

====
[source,java]
----
private MeilisearchOperations operations;

BaseQuery query = SimpleQuery.builder()
    .withQ("action")
    .build();

SearchHits<Movie> results = operations.search(query, Movie.class);
----
====

[[meilisearch.operations.multi-search]]
== Multi-Search Support

For scenarios where multiple search queries need to be executed in a single request, you can use the multi-search API:

====
[source,java]
----
private MeilisearchOperations operations;

List<IndexQuery> queries = List.of(
    IndexQuery.builder()
        .withQ("action")
        .build(),
    IndexQuery.builder()
        .withQ("drama")
        .build()
);

SearchHits<Movie> results = operations.multiSearch(queries, Movie.class);
