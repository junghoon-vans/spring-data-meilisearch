[[meilisearch.settings.overview]]
== Overview

Meilisearch settings are used to define the behavior of the search engine.
Using `@Setting` annotation, you can define the settings for the index.

====
[source,java]
----
@Document(indexUid = "products")
@Setting(
  sortAttributes = { "productId" },                                                  <.>
  distinctAttribute = "productId",                                                   <.>
  searchableAttributes = { "description", "brand", "color" },                        <.>
  displayedAttributes = { "description", "brand", "color", "productId" },            <.>
  rankingRules = { "typo", "words", "proximity", "attribute", "sort", "exactness" }, <.>
  stopWords = { "a", "an", "the" },                                                  <.>
)
class Product {
    @Id private String id;
    private String description;
    private String brand;
    private String color;
    private String productId;
}
----
<.> The `sortAttributes` attribute is used to define the fields that must be used for sorting the results.
<.> The `distinctAttribute` attribute is used to define the field that must be used to remove duplicates from the results.
<.> The `searchableAttributes` attribute is used to define the fields that must be used for searching the results.
<.> The `displayedAttributes` attribute is used to define the fields that must be displayed in the results.
<.> The `rankingRules` attribute is used to define the ranking rules that must be used for sorting the results.
<.> The `stopWords` attribute is used to define the stop words that must be used for searching the results.

[[meilisearch.settings.pagination]]
== Pagination

Meilisearch's search function is limited to return a maximum of 1,000 results.
Therefore, `search(SearchRequest searchRequest, Class<?> clazz)` in MeilisearchOperation can't return more than 1,000 results.

If you have more than 1,000 results, you must use `@Pagination` annotation to extract the remaining results.

====
[source,java]
----
@Document(indexUid = "products")
@Setting(
  pagination = @Pagination(maxTotalHits = 2000)                                       <.>
)
class Product {
    @Id private String id;
    private String description;
    private String brand;
    private String color;
    private String productId;
}
----
<.> The `maxTotalHits` is used to define the maximum number of results that must be returned by the search engine.
