= Document Definition

To define the https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/core_concepts/documents[Document], you need to annotate a class with `@Document` annotation.
As an example, the following class defines a `Movie` document with `id`, `title`, `description` and `genres` fields.

[source,java]
----
@Document(indexUid = "movies")
public class Movie {
    @Id private int id;
    private String title;
    private String description;
    private String[] genres;
}
----

== Index UID

The https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/core_concepts/indexes#index-uid[Index UID] is a unique identifier for an index.
It must be defined for each document with `@Document` annotation.

== Document id

The https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/core_concepts/primary_key#document-id[Document id] is a unique identifier for a document in an index.
It can be defined with `@Id` annotation or `id` field.
